## Mission {-}

The mission of the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL) is to deliver solutions to our Nation’s most challenging coastal and hydraulic problems through research, development and application of cutting-edge science, engineering and technology. To support this mission, CHL is adopting this Numerical Technology Modernization Strategy (NTMS) to revolutionize the way it develops, applies, transitions into practice, and maintains numerical technologies developed for Civil Works and Military applications. The goals of the strategy are to guide CHL’s investments in numerical and data technologies; to improve numerical modeling and data integration infrastructure; to establish a common system for digital technology development and maintenance, considering the entire business life cycle (from development to retirement) of CHL’s software and data products; to improve and integrate relevant data and numerical technologies, from simple tools and calculators to expert modeling systems, so that they are efficient to access, apply, and cost less to use and maintain; and to document a plan to facilitate interagency collaboration as well as for leveraging and growing resources.


## Goals {-}

- Guide investments in numerical and data technologies.  
- Improve numerical modeling and data integration infrastructure.  
- Establish a common system for digital technology development and maintenance.  
- Improve and integrate relevant data and numerical technologies.  
- Make data and numerical technologies efficient to access and apply while costing less to use and maintain.  
- Document the vision to foster ERDC, interagency, and academic collaboration and to leverage resources


## Glossary and Acronymns {-}

- _[ADCIRC](https://adcirc.org/)_: "a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element method in space allowing the use of highly flexible, unstructured grids." For this study, ADCIRC was used to predict storm surge.
- _[AdH](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476708/ada/)_: Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) numerical code is "a modular, parallel, adaptive finite-element model for one-, two- and three-dimensional (2D, and 3D) flow and transport." For this study, AdH was used to predict changes in local hydrodynamics.
